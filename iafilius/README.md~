	- 2017/12/10 added menu item to set power
	- 2017/12/09 due to space limitations, and menu development option
	  to disable UART/serial compile time. -D__NOUART__ in Makefile

	- 2017/12/09 simple menu can choose V in, Vout, or I out by pressing set button.
	- renamed uint16_to_char  to uint16_to_digit, and returns the value of the digit instead the char value

	-code/calibration for BST400
	-dratically reduce uart code size, now uses 5K!!!! (of maximum of 8K)
		-remove partial string redundancy (dipalcved strings, or near duplicate strings (lowercase/upper case, with : or without)
